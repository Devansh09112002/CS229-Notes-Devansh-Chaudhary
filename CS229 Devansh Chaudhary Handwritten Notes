This is undoubtedly the best Machine Learning course on the internet. Each lecture was a deep dive into the core principles. Dr. Anand Avati's teaching style is incredibly effective. The in-depth explanations and the intuition behind each concept were very helpful.
At its core, machine learning is built on mathematics. This course has a stronger emphasis on mathematical and visual intuitions. Topics covered include:

1. Mathematics for Machine Learning: Linear Algebra, Matrix Calculus, Probability,  Statistics
2. Supervised Learning
3. Deep Learning
4. Reinforcement Learning
5. Unsupervised Learning
6. Dimensionality Reduction and Representation Learning
7. Evaluation and Model Selection
8. Statistical Learning Theory
9. Practical Insights 

I've created detailed handwritten notes (Attached) to document the key takeaways and capture the concepts in my own words for better understanding and reference.
